# End-to-End Customer Churn Prediction

## Project Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive end-to-end data science project focused on predicting customer churn for a telecommunications company. The project demonstrates the complete machine learning lifecycle from data acquisition and exploration to model deployment and monitoring, with the goal of identifying customers at risk of canceling their service so the company can proactively implement retention strategies.

## Business Problem

Customer churn (the loss of clients or customers) presents a significant challenge for telecom companies, as acquiring new customers typically costs more than retaining existing ones. By accurately predicting which customers are likely to churn, companies can:

1. Take targeted actions to retain high-value customers
2. Allocate retention resources more efficiently
3. Identify and address common causes of customer dissatisfaction
4. Increase customer lifetime value and overall profitability

## Dataset

The analysis utilizes a telecommunications customer dataset containing:

- **Customer Demographics**: Age, gender, partner status, dependents
- **Account Information**: Contract type, tenure, payment method
- **Service Details**: Phone service, internet service, TV streaming, online security
- **Financial Data**: Monthly charges, total charges
- **Churn Status**: Whether the customer left within the last month (target variable)

## Project Structure

The project follows a structured approach to the data science workflow:

## Methodology

### 1. Data Collection and Exploration

- **Data Collection**: Gathered historical customer data from the company's CRM system
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: 
  - Examined data distributions, correlations, and patterns
  - Identified key factors associated with churn
  - Created visualizations to understand customer behavior
  - Analyzed demographic segments and their churn rates

### 2. Data Preprocessing

- **Data Cleaning**:
  - Handled missing values through appropriate imputation techniques
  - Detected and addressed outliers
  - Fixed inconsistencies in categorical variables
- **Feature Engineering**:
  - Created new features like customer lifetime value and service usage trends
  - Derived indicators for service changes and billing issues
  - Constructed features capturing the recency, frequency, and monetary value (RFM) of customer behavior
- **Data Transformation**:
  - Encoded categorical variables using one-hot encoding and target encoding
  - Normalized numerical features
  - Addressed class imbalance using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)

### 3. Model Development

Implemented and compared multiple machine learning algorithms:

- **Logistic Regression**: As a baseline model with high interpretability
- **Random Forest**: To capture complex non-linear relationships
- **Gradient Boosting Machines**: Using XGBoost and LightGBM for optimal performance
- **Neural Networks**: Deep learning approach for capturing intricate patterns

**Hyperparameter Optimization**:
- Used Bayesian optimization with cross-validation to tune model parameters
- Employed regularization techniques to prevent overfitting
- Balanced model complexity against performance metrics

### 4. Model Evaluation

Comprehensive evaluation using:

- **Performance Metrics**:
  - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
  - ROC-AUC and PR-AUC curves
  - Confusion matrices
- **Business Metrics**:
  - Expected profit from retention campaigns
  - Customer lifetime value saved
  - ROI of intervention strategies
- **Feature Importance Analysis**:
  - SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values
  - Permutation importance
  - Partial dependence plots

### 5. Insights and Recommendations

Key findings included:

- Contract type is the strongest predictor of churn, with month-to-month contracts having the highest risk
- Customers with multiple services (phone, internet, security) are less likely to churn
- Recent billing issues significantly increase churn probability
- Longevity of customer relationship correlates with reduced churn risk
- Specific demographic segments show distinct churn patterns

Business recommendations:

- Target high-risk customers with personalized retention offers
- Review pricing strategies for month-to-month contracts
- Implement proactive service quality monitoring
- Develop cross-selling strategies for complementary services
- Address common pain points in the customer journey

### 6. Model Deployment

- **API Development**: Created a REST API using Flask/FastAPI for real-time churn predictions
- **Dashboard Creation**: Developed an interactive dashboard using Streamlit/Dash for business users

- **Batch Processing**: Implemented scheduled batch prediction jobs for regular assessment

### 7. Monitoring and Maintenance

- **Model Performance Tracking**: Continuous monitoring of prediction accuracy
- **Data Drift Detection**: Automated alerts for changes in input data distributions
- **Retraining Pipeline**: Scheduled model retraining based on performance thresholds
- **A/B Testing**: Framework for testing retention strategies based on model predictions
